After cloning the project

Get into project folder and run 

chmod 755 Project_Structure.sh ==> To set permissions to the script

Now to run the Script we need to use the command ./Project_Structure.sh 

The script asks for two scripts one is for "Name of the Project"

Second is for "Path of the old code"

Its done 

THANK YOU
